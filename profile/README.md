Research within the NEO group focuses into bio-inspired electronics using functional oxides, for the next generation of AI hardware. The multi-level, non-volatile memories are the building blocks for Compute in Memory architectures. The unique properties of ferroelectric switching are leveraged to mimic plasticity in biological synapses.

The nanofabrication of the neuromorphic devices is performed using the state-of-the-art facilities at the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center (BRNC).
